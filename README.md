# MediLab

"This is a very interesting advanced Java project. It is a hospital management project made using Java core concepts and advanced Java tools and technology. The project starts with the index page or home page, which includes navigation links for admin login, doctor login, appointment, and user login.

The admin has access to all resources and can perform various actions such as adding doctors, viewing appointments, viewing users, viewing doctors, adding specialists, viewing patients, and seeing the total number of appointments.

Next, there is a doctors' section where doctors can log in to their accounts and view the number of appointments assigned to them. Doctors can also see patient details such as full name, gender, age, appointment, email, mobile number, diseases, the name of the particular doctor, address, and appointment status (whether the appointment is done or not). If the appointment is completed, the doctor can leave a comment indicating that the appointment is done. Doctors can also edit their name, qualifications, and other account details, as well as change their password.

Then, there is the user section where users can register and log in to their accounts. Users can book appointments with doctors, view their past appointments, change their password, and update their account details. Users can check the appointment status, which will show as 'pending' until the appointment is completed, at which point it will turn green."
